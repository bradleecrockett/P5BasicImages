# P5 Basics Images

* First, we are going to read the P5 Images Documentation: https://p5js.org/reference/p5/image/ 

* Second, we will watch a short video about working with P5JS Images. https://youtu.be/friYx8xdLOELinks

Now Open VS Code on your computer.

* Clone https://github.com/bradleecrockett/P5BasicImages.gitLinks to an external site. 
* Follow the comments in `sketch.js` to create additional TigerPaws
* Finally, try adding a second new image. Remember that your images must be saved in the project's folder with all the other files.
* What can you create? 
* You need to have at least 2 different images and at least one should be animated (move).
